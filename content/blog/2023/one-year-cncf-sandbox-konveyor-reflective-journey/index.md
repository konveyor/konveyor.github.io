It has been an exceptional year for Konveyor since its admission into the CNCF in July 2022. Since then, the project has undergone a series of transformative changes and remarkable achievements, guided by a newly [updated charter](https://github.com/konveyor/community/blob/main/Charter.md) that has refocused Konveyor's mission towards refactoring and replatforming legacy applications. In this post, we invite you to join us on a journey down memory lane as we celebrate the numerous milestones, both big and small, that our dedicated contributors have accomplished over the past year.

In the initial months following Konveyor's acceptance into the CNCF sandbox, considerable effort was invested in establishing essential contributor documentation, forming a steering committee, and embracing best practices for repository management. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to [Josh Berkus](http://berkus.org/) and [Lenka Bočincová](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenka-bočincová-0602a493/) from Red Hat OSPO for their invaluable guidance in onboarding Konveyor into the CNCF. [CNCF TAG-Contribex](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy) has developed [project templates](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/templates/) that played a vital role in expediting our onboarding process. These templates encompassed everything from code of conduct to vulnerability management, demonstrating the thoughtful process of the TAG-Contribex team in helping project maintainers onboard easily. 

With the revised charter, Konveyor's mission has now evolved to "Accelerate the adoption of Kubernetes by assisting organizations in modernizing their legacy applications with Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies in a secure and predictable manner at scale, delivering value at every stage of the adoption journey." The project's future vision is encapsulated in the [Unified Experience](https://github.com/konveyor/enhancements/tree/master/enhancements/unified_experience), which serves as our guiding light for all development efforts. The evolution of Konveyor's roadmap is clearly evident, commencing with the initial emphasis on surfacing information in its 0.1 release. Subsequent release 0.2, extended this focus to enable the planning of work in the form of migration waves, culminating in a significant milestone in 0.3 - a comprehensive rewrite of the analysis engine. This rewrite is built upon the Language Server Protocol, laying the foundation for multi-language analysis capabilities. Currently, this feature supports Java and Go, with active development underway to extend this support to .NET/C#.

We are excited to share that [Claranet](https://claranet.com) is the latest contributor and community supporter of Konveyor. Their collaboration has been invaluable, as they have shared their extensive migration experience and knowledge, greatly enhancing the assessment of applications within the project. Claranet has introduced [the Konveyor Add-On for Amazon EKS Blueprints](https://github.com/claranet-ch/konveyor-eks-blueprint-addon), and they have also [packaged Konveyor for effortless deployment on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-3pur2yyywakts), simplifying the onboarding process for organizations embarking on their modernization journey. If you have migration experiences to share, we encourage you to join the [Konveyor community meetings](https://github.com/konveyor/community#konveyor-community-meetings).

For the stats enthusiasts among us, here are some interesting metrics from the past year:

* New Contributors: 38
* Pull Requests: 2.44K
* Issues Addressed: 903
* Total Contributions: 21.7K

As we reflect on the remarkable progress achieved over the past year, we want to express our heartfelt gratitude to our contributors and supporters. It is your dedication and support that have made these achievements possible. We look forward to another year of growth, collaboration, and success in the Konveyor project.
