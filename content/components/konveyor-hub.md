  title: Modernize with insights
  description: > 
    View, classify, assess, and analyze your applications from a web console by integrating the hub with source code and binaries repositories. Use tags and archetypes to add descriptions and automatically classify apps. Categorize them by multiple dimensions like business service and technology stack You can then assess and analyze archetypes that represent the bulk of apps that you want to modernize. This helps you find insights that scale execution.

  title: Uncover migration risks
  description: > 
    Leverage a questionnaire-based assessment and a source code or binary analysis to find the items that need to be addressed for successful modernization. Assess or analyze up to thousands of apps at once. The results can help you estimate migration costs. They can also auto-tag your apps, helping accurately classify them. With reports that aggregate information, you can more easily identify portfolio-wide trends or drill down to the single line of source code.

  title: Assess and analyze custom frameworks and languages
  description: > 
    You can build your own questionnaires and analysis rulesets to find issues, risks, and estimated effort related to your custom technologies. This enables you to assess or analyze up to thousands of these apps at once. You can also build your own tags to categorize apps based on your needs.

  title: Scale with a repeatable workflow
  description: > 
    Once a migration approach is validated with representative apps (archetypes), you can share priorities, analysis rulesets, and guidance with developers to incorporate enterprise standards. Developers can send newfound issues to project leads for resolution. Konveyor developer tools can then help speed up replatforming and refactoring based on your enterpriseâ€™s unique application modernization approach. See Konveyor CLI and Konveyor AI for more information.
